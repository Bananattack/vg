vg is just a toy project for now. So far, it has some windowing and 2D software
rendering. It plans to support input (keyboard, mouse, joystick), timing, maps,
entities, audio, and Lua scripting. Maybe some other stuff.

Right now, it just works on Windows, will hopefully be cross-platform some day.

Come back when I have something more, and see license.txt.
